defmodule UniversalProxy.Bluez.Client do
  @moduledoc """
  Persistent `rebus` D-Bus client + service to `org.bluez`, driving BLE
  scanning and turning device signals into advertisements for
  `UniversalProxy.ESPHome.BluetoothScanner`.

  Supports both scanner modes Home Assistant can request (`set_mode/1`,
  called via `BluetoothScanner.set_scanner_mode/1`):

    * `:passive` (default) — a BlueZ `AdvertisementMonitor`. We never send
      scan requests, so scannable peripherals don't burn battery answering
      us. Requires *exporting* a D-Bus object BlueZ calls back into, so this
      process is both a client and a service (via the forked rebus's
      `set_method_handler/2`).
    * `:active` — `Adapter1.StartDiscovery` with an LE filter. BlueZ sends
      scan requests, so SCAN_RSP data (e.g. device names) is collected —
      parity with ESP32 proxies' active mode.

  Device data arrives the same way in both modes
  (`InterfacesAdded`/`PropertiesChanged` on `Device1` objects), so the
  advert pipeline downstream is mode-agnostic.

  Flow:

    1. `Rebus.connect(:system)`, `set_method_handler(self())`, monitor the
       connection, and install bus match rules for org.bluez device signals.
    2. Power the adapter on, then engage `configured_mode/0`: either
       `AdvertisementMonitorManager1.RegisterMonitor` our root object (BlueZ
       enumerates the monitor via `ObjectManager.GetManagedObjects` and calls
       `Activate`/`DeviceFound` on it; the monitor's `or_patterns` (FLAGS
       \\x02/\\x06/\\x1a) match effectively all advertisers — the habluetooth
       "match all" recipe), or `SetDiscoveryFilter` + `StartDiscovery`.
    3. Matched devices surface as `InterfacesAdded`/`PropertiesChanged` signals;
       props are unwrapped (`UniversalProxy.Bluez.Variant`) and fed to
       `UniversalProxy.Bluez.DeviceCache`, which reconstructs + emit-gates and
       returns the adverts to fan out via `BluetoothScanner.on_advertisement/1`.

  Mode transitions:

    * Run in a Task — BlueZ calls `GetManagedObjects` back on us before
      `RegisterMonitor` returns, so the GenServer must stay free to answer —
      and are serialized: at most one in flight, identified by a generation
      ref so a stale Task result can't corrupt state. A `set_mode/1` arriving
      mid-transition parks in a one-slot pending queue keyed by target mode:
      callers asking for the same target coalesce (all get `:ok` when it
      lands); a different target displaces them with `{:error, :superseded}`
      (latest target wins).
    * Transitions engage the new mode BEFORE disengaging the old one
      (monitor and discovery can legally coexist in BlueZ): a failed engage
      leaves the previous mode still scanning rather than going dark.
      Disengage is best-effort, and self-healing lives in engage's
      idempotency: whatever drifted, re-engaging treats
      `AlreadyExists`/`InProgress` as success, so the next transition always
      converges on the target mode.
    * The configured mode persists in `:persistent_term` across Client
      restarts: a bluetoothd/connection crash re-engages what HA chose
      rather than silently reverting to passive.

  Resilience:

    * The rebus connection is monitored; if it dies (e.g. a malformed bus
      frame `:stop`s it) the Client stops and the supervisor restarts it,
      re-establishing the connection.
    * Setup retries via `send_after` (not `Process.sleep`) so the GenServer
      stays responsive while waiting for `bluetoothd` to claim org.bluez.
