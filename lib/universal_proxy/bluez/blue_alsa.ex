defmodule UniversalProxy.Bluez.BlueAlsa do
  @moduledoc """
  Persistent `rebus` D-Bus client to `org.bluealsa` (the bluez-alsa
  `bluealsad` daemon), used to learn which A2DP-playback PCMs are *ready to
  open* right now. This is the control-plane half of the Bluetooth-headphone
  audio path; the data plane is sendspin opening the ALSA PCM string directly.

  `pcms/0` returns, for every connected A2DP headset, the information
  `UniversalProxy.Bluetooth.AudioSink` needs to surface it as a Sendspin
  output:

      %{
        mac: "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF",
        pcm_path: "/org/bluealsa/hci0/dev_.../a2dpsrc/sink",
        alsa_string: "bluealsa:DEV=AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF,PROFILE=a2dp",
        alias: "WH-1000XM4"   # org.bluez Device1.Alias, falls back to the MAC
      }

  ## Connection, not the daemon

  This client connects to the **system bus** (owned by `dbus-daemon`, the first
  child of `UniversalProxy.Bluez`), not to `bluealsad`. So it comes up whether
  or not `bluealsad` has claimed `org.bluealsa` yet; the `GetManagedObjects`
  call simply errors (→ `[]`) until the daemon is up, and starts returning PCMs
  once a headset connects. It survives a `bluealsad` restart without reconnecting.

  ## PCM enumeration (bluez-alsa v4 API)

  PCMs are discovered via the freedesktop `ObjectManager` at `/org/bluealsa`
  (each connected A2DP playback PCM is an `org.bluealsa.PCM1` object), **not**
  the v3 `org.bluealsa.Manager1.GetPCMs` method — buildroot ships bluez-alsa
  4.x, where that method no longer exists (it returns `UnknownMethod`, which the
  error path would silently swallow into `[]`).

  ## Inert off-target / when not started

  The `UniversalProxy.Bluez` subtree only runs on the BT targets, so on
  host/CI this GenServer isn't started. `pcms/0` catches the `:exit` from
  calling a non-existent process and returns `[]`, mirroring the exit-safe
  pattern used elsewhere in the Bluez layer — callers stay inert.

  Enrichment with the device `Alias` is a best-effort `org.bluez`
  `Properties.Get` on the same connection (BlueAlsa already proves D-Bus is
  reachable); a failed Alias lookup falls back to the MAC, never raises.
