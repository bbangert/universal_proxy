defmodule UniversalProxy.Bluez.Agent do
  @moduledoc """
  The `org.bluez.Agent1` pairing agent backing `Bluez.Gatt`'s `pair/1`
  (Phase 2 of the Bluetooth proxy).

  bluetoothd resolves pairing IO through an agent: when `Device1.Pair()`
  is called it uses the agent registered by the *calling* D-Bus
  connection, falling back to the bus-wide **default agent**. The Pair
  call is made on `Bluez.Gatt`'s connection (which registers no agent),
  so this process must be the default agent — `RegisterAgent` alone is
  not enough; `RequestDefaultAgent` is what routes Gatt's pairings here.

  Capability is `NoInputNoOutput`, so bluetoothd negotiates Just Works
  with every peripheral — the same IO posture as an ESP32 ESPHome proxy.
  Just Works pairing normally completes without any agent callback;
  everything below is for the exceptional paths.

  ## Security posture

  A default agent answers for *all* pairing on the adapter, including a
  hypothetical inbound attempt (the adapter is never made discoverable,
  so none is expected). Authorization-style callbacks
  (`RequestConfirmation`, `RequestAuthorization`, `AuthorizeService`)
  are therefore confirmed **only for device paths with an in-flight
  `Device1.Pair()` we initiated** — `Bluez.Gatt` brackets each Pair call
  with `expect_pairing/1` / `pairing_done/1` — and rejected otherwise.
  PIN/passkey callbacks are always rejected: we have no IO to display or
  collect one, and under NoInputNoOutput bluetoothd should never send
  them.

  Like `Bluez.Client`, this is both a D-Bus client (registration calls)
  and a service (bluetoothd calls back into our exported object) on its
  own rebus connection — its failure domain is pairing only; scanning
  and GATT traffic are untouched. If the Agent is down, `Pair()` still
  proceeds for devices that need no interaction; anything needing the
  agent fails cleanly on the BlueZ side.
