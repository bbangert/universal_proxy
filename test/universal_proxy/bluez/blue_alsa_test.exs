defmodule UniversalProxy.Bluez.BlueAlsaTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Host tests for `UniversalProxy.Bluez.BlueAlsa`'s pure/observable behavior.

  The GenServer itself can't be started here — `init/1` calls
  `Rebus.connect(:system)`, and there's no system bus on the host (it's part of
  the BT subtree, compile-gated off). So we exercise the signal→PubSub mapping
  by calling `handle_info/2` directly with a constructed state + message, which
  is exactly what the live process would receive from `Rebus.add_signal_handler`.
